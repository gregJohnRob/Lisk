Maps
-----

Maps in LISK are essentially a Graph.

They will be rendered in a Client size grid of X x Y pixels with the Map image behind it.
Nodes will have an <X,Y> Co-ord which'll place it on this grid
Edges will define what Nodes connect to what Nodes, which defines what area can attack other areas.

Maps In Action
--------------
Client Grid:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 (X)
1
2 x     x     x
3     x     x     x
4
5 x       x     x x
6
7   x   x   x     x
8   x       x     x
9       x
(Y)
Nodes=
<X,Y> = ID
<1,2> = 0
<1,5> = 1
<2,7> = 2
<2,8> = 3
<3,3> = 4
<4,2> = 5
...
..
<9,7> = 16
<9,8> = 17

We define edges as<ID,ID> where these are the IDs of the Nodes connected
<0,2> = Node <1,2> is connected to <2,7>

NOTE: Nodes can't connect themselves


Map Files
---------
A Map file should look like:


NAME                   (MAX 24 characters)
MAP IMAGE ID
Num Nodes
!#Nodes
..

..
..

!# Edges
